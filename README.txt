Solves the 2D heat equation on a square domain using a uniform mesh of 
right triangle elements, employing Gauss quadrature and coordinate
transformations for solving individual matrix entries. Currently only
supports homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, however I am
in the process of adding support for Neumann and Robin boundary 
conditions as well. The program is run from the main.m.
